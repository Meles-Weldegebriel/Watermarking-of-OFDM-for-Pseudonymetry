1. The file Comparison_Heuristic_vs_EM.m is used to plot the experimental results when threshold is determined via Heuristic approach and Expectation Maximization. It corresponds to Figure 6 in the IEEE ICC 2024 paper.
2. The file Data_BER_vs_Modulation_index.m corresponds to Figure 3 in the IEEE ICC 2024 paper. It shows the impact of watermarking on the data demodulation at the intended receivers.
3. The file Pseudonym_BER_Experimental_vs_Theory.m corresponds to Figure 5 in the paper. It compares the experimental results with the theoretical results in Figure 2.
4. The file Pseudonym_BER_vs_Mod_index_theory.m corresponds to Figure 2 in the paper.
5. The file Pseudonymetry_RX.ipynb is used for postprocessing collected OFDM samples. Using three different approaches for threshold estimation, we estimate the probability of pseudonym bit error vs Eb/No for different modulation indexes.
